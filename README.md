# Simple MVC Routing

This builds on the Hello World sample and adds a little MVC (Model-View-Controller) to our project.

Shows how to create a simple **Controller** with two actions and two ways of setting routes. One way is to
set routing templates in the `Startup` class, and the other is add a RouteAttribute allowing us to define
routes on methods and classes. 

## Run

1. Make sure you have .NET Core installed on your Windows, Linux or Mac-hine
2. `dotnet restore`
3. `dotnet run`

Enjoy.
